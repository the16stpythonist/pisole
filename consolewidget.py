class SimpleConsoleWidget(GridLayout):
    """
    The SimpleConsoleWidget is a kivy Widget meant to emulate a terminal-like experience, consisting of a single
    GridLayout, containing a SimpleConsoleInputLine Widget at the bottom of the window, providing a single line of
    possible command input on default, and a SimpleConsoleOutput widget to display the printed history of command info,
    error, result etc. Messages.

    The console widget supports dynamic syntax highlighting of a python 3 based coding language
    within the input line. The style of this syntax highlighting can either be one of the predefined color schemes of
    this module (orange, green) or any style offered by the pygments module(which also provides the Lexer for Syntax
    highlighting): http://pygments.org/

    The Font used by the input line as well as the output labels is called 'Inconsolata' and is meant to be a modern
    alternative to the old school pixelated console fonts: http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html
    The output labels support and encourage the use of kivys markup language to generate colored text and BBCode style
    text anchors

    The input line offers the following additional features, aside from simple text entry:
    - Syntax Highlighting using the Python 3 Lexer, provided by the python module "pygments"(comes with kivy)
    - Multi line code input support. Upon pressing the TAB key the height of the widget will extend by one line and the
      - Pressing the TAB key, when the cursor is positioned right after a ":" will result in a automatic indent of the
        next line. The widget will also keep track of the current indent level, continueing it with every additional new
        line, until the indent is explicitly removed
    - A cache, storing all previously entered commands, that can be scrolled through by pressing the UP and DOWN key,
      with the input line focused, changing the input lines text to be the cached command (a command that has been begun
      will not get lost, but instead be always the latest item of the cache)
